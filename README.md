📦 Inventory Management Systems
🔍 Project Title: SMART_INVENT – AI-Powered Demand Forecasting for Food Businesses
SMART_INVENT is an intelligent inventory forecasting model developed specifically for restaurants and cafés. It employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, to accurately predict customer demand using historical order trends. This deep learning approach is ideal for identifying time-based patterns like seasonality and consumer behavior changes.

🛠️ Model Workflow and Functionality
1. Data Preprocessing
Imported historical demand data related to food items.

Selected essential features and cleaned the data by handling any null or missing values.

Applied normalization techniques to scale values for better LSTM performance.

2. LSTM Model Design
Constructed a Sequential LSTM model with a hidden layer comprising 50 neurons.

Reshaped the dataset into 3D format (samples, time steps, features) suitable for LSTM processing.

Trained the model to capture fluctuations in daily and weekly demand patterns.

3. Prediction and Performance
Generated future demand predictions on the test dataset.

Created a visual comparison of actual vs predicted demand using a dual-line plot (blue = actual, orange = predicted).

Evaluated model accuracy using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

💡 Financial Forecasting Integration
To connect demand forecasting with business profitability, a basic financial model was integrated:

𝑦

𝑚
⋅
𝑥
(
𝑡
)
−
𝐶
y=m⋅x(t)−C
Where:

y = Net profit or revenue

m = Price per unit sold

x(t) = Predicted demand at time t

C = Total fixed cost (production + maintenance)

Example:
Selling price (m) = ₹1000/unit
Fixed costs (C) = ₹1,00,000
If predicted demand x(t) = 200 units →

 profit
y=1000⋅200−100000=₹1,00,000 profit
This equation empowers businesses to:

Estimate profit based on demand trends.

Align inventory levels with sales expectations.

Make data-driven decisions regarding budgeting and resource allocation.

✅ Final Outcome
The SMART_INVENT system successfully showcased how LSTM-based deep learning can be applied for accurate demand forecasting. When coupled with financial modeling, it becomes a strategic tool for optimizing both inventory and profitability, helping food businesses thrive in a competitive market.
